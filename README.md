# NLP Projects Repository

Welcome to my NLP projects repository! This repository contains two distinct Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects, each showcasing different aspects of NLP and deep learning models. Below, you'll find detailed descriptions of each project, the models used, and instructions on how to run the projects.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Twitter Sentiment Analysis using CNN Models
In this project, I implemented Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to perform sentiment analysis on Twitter data. The following models were used:
- LeNet-5
- Inception

#### Features:
- Text preprocessing including tokenization, stemming, and stop word removal.
- Implementation of CNN models for effective sentiment analysis.

### 2. Text Generation Task: Comparing RNN and LSTM Models
This project involves a comparative study on text generation tasks using two types of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):
- Vanilla RNN
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

#### Features:
- Comprehensive text preprocessing.
- Comparison of text generation capabilities of RNN and LSTM models.

## Setup and Execution

To run these projects, you need to use Kaggle Notebooks. Follow the steps below to set up and execute each project:

1. **Open Kaggle Notebooks:**
   - Go to [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).
   - Create a new notebook or open an existing one.

2. **Import Project Files:**
   - Upload the project files from this repository into your Kaggle notebook.

3. **Activate GPU:**
   - In the right-side panel, go to **Settings**.
   - Under **Accelerator**, select **GPU (T4)**.

4. **Run the Notebook:**
   - Execute the notebook cells sequentially to run the project.
